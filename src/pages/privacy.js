            Yes. We may use web tracking tools such as cookies and web beacons.
            A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your
            hard drive when you visit those pages, but the only personal
            information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.
            We may use cookies to track User traffic patterns when you click on
            various links throughout the CCDL to help us understand your
            preferences and to offer better experiences and tools on the CCDL.

            We follow generally accepted industry security standards to

            security, and properly use your personal information. However, no
